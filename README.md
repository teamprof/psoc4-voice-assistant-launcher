# Voice Assistant Launcher (PSoC4 and EZ-BLE firmware)
### Existing Voice Assistance (e.g. Google Assistance/Siri) keeps capturing data from microphone all the time, in order to detect the trigger words/phrases like "Hey Google" / "Siri". This causes a privacy concern as user may be unwilling to be listened by the Voice Assistance 24x7. 
### In additional, unintentional trigger may happen by a third party whose speaks the trigger words/phrases but captured by the Voice Assistance.
### This PSoC4 firmware leverages the Infineon's CapSense technology to implement a voice trigger commander. 
### User moves his/her finger on the CapSense trackpad with a rotate-clocksize gesture. The PSoC 4100S sends an "EventLaunch" message to Android device via the EZ-BLE module. The VoiceAssistantLauncher APP installed on the Android device launches Google Assistant once received the "EventLaunch" message.

## Compile/build and program firmware 
1. Download and decompress the firmware source from github
2. Launch PSoC Creator 4.4 on Windows
3. Open the decompressed workspace. (There are two projects: EZ-BLE_PRoC_Module and VoiceAssistantLauncher on the workspace) 
4. Set 'EZ-BLE_PRoC_Module' as active project. 
5. Clean and build EZ-BLE_PRoC_Module 
[![Build BLE module](images/build-ble-module.jpg)](https://github.com/teamprof/psoc4-voice-assistant-launcher/tree/main/images/build-ble-module.jpg)
6. Switch KitProg2 to EZ-BLE PRoC Module (SW5 to bottom position)
[![KitProg2 switch](images/KitProg2-switch.jpg)](https://github.com/teamprof/psoc4-voice-assistant-launcher/tree/main/images/KitProg2-switch.jpg)
7. Connect CY8CKIT-041-41XX to PC with an USB cable. Program the BLE_PRoC_Module firmware to CY8CKIT-041-41XX's EZ-BLE PRoC Module

8. Unplug the USB cable between CY8CKIT-041-41XX and PC
9. Switch KitProg2 back to PSoC 4100S (SW5 to top position)
10. Set 'VoiceAssistantLauncher' as active project. 
11. Clean and build VoiceAssistantLauncher
[![Build Voice Assistant](images/build-voice-assistant.jpg)](https://github.com/teamprof/psoc4-voice-assistant-launcher/tree/main/images/build-voice-assistant.jpg)
12. Connect CY8CKIT-041-41XX to PC with an USB cable again. Program the VoiceAssistantLauncher firmware to CY8CKIT-041-41XX's PSoC 4100S
13. Press the "Reset" button on CY8CKIT-041-41XX
[![Reset button](images/button-reset.jpg)](https://github.com/teamprof/psoc4-voice-assistant-launcher/tree/main/images/button-reset.jpg)
14. Draw a clockwise circle in the trackpad area with a finger. The Green LED should be on if everything goes smooth.
