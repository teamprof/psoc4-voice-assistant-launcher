# Voice Assistant Launcher (PSoC4 firmware)
### Existing Voice Assistance (e.g. Google Assistance/Siri) keeps capturing data from microphone all the time, in order to detect the trigger words/phrases like Hey Google / Siri. This causes a privacy concern as user may be unwilling to be listened by the Voice Assistance 24x7. 
### In additional, unintentional trigger may happen by a third party whose speaks the trigger words/phrases but captured by the Voice Assistance.
### This PSoC4 firmware leverages the Infineon's CapSense technology to implement a voice trigger commander.
